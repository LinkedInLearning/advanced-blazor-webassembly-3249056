Looking to take your skills to the next level with Blazor WebAssembly? This course is designed to help you become a more advanced Blazor WebAssembly user, building upon the materials taught in instructor David Grace’s introductory course Blazor WebAssembly: Foundational Skills.

Discover more skills a developer needs to know to set up and run a coding system like a pro, including JavaScript interoperability, Razor components, SignalR, file uploads and downloads, state management, and prerendering. Test out your new skills along the way in the exercise challenges at the end of each section. Upon completing this course, you’ll be prepared to perform end-to-end testing on your app when it's finally ready to go to production.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
